/**
 * # Binary Search
 *
 * ## Steps
 * 1. Let min = 0 and max = n-1.
 * 2. Compute guess as the average of max and min, rounded down (so that it is an integer).
 * 3. If array[guess] equals target, then stop. You found it! Return guess.
 * 4. If the guess was too low, that is, array[guess] < target, then set min = guess + 1.
 * 5. Otherwise, the guess was too high. Set max = guess - 1.
 * 6. Go back to step 2.
